# CISC 260: HW 1 - Hexadecimal to Integer

## Assignment Write-up

Write a program in the language of your choice which takes as input a string representation of an
unsigned hexadecimal number in 32 bits and returns the positive integer that is the base 10
equivalent.

1. You do not need to worry about negative values for this question
2. You can use a dictionary, or brute force to convert hex digits to numbers (i.e. write a function
with a bunch of if statements or a select statement to deal with digits A-F. or store the values
0-F as keys in a dictionary with the values being the number the digit represents.
